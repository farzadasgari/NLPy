## Introduction

The `NLPy` repository aims to provide educational materials and practical examples for learning NLP with Python. It includes Jupyter notebooks that cover fundamental NLP topics and techniques, making it suitable for both beginners and advanced learners.

## Terminologies

Before diving into the notebooks, familiarize yourself with key NLP terminologies:

- **Word**: A single unit of text, typically separated by spaces.
- **Token**: A word or a meaningful unit of text extracted from a larger corpus.
- **Vocabulary**: The set of all unique tokens in a text corpus.
- **Sentence**: A sequence of words that forms a complete thought.
- **Document**: A collection of sentences or text.
- **Corpus**: A large and structured set of texts used for analysis.
- **Stopwords**: Common words that are usually removed during text preprocessing (e.g., "the", "is").
- **Tokenization**: The process of splitting text into tokens (words or sentences).
- **Stemming and Lemmatization**: Techniques for reducing words to their base forms.
- **Language Model**: A statistical model that predicts the likelihood of sequences of words.
- **Word Vectors**: Numerical representations of words used in various NLP tasks.

## Text Preprocessing

Learn how to preprocess text data to prepare it for further analysis. This includes tokenization and other essential preprocessing steps.

- **Notebook**: [01-introduction.ipynb](01-introduction.ipynb)
- **Content**: Introduction to NLP and Python, basic concepts and terminologies.

## Removing Stopwords

Understand how to remove stopwords from text to focus on meaningful words.

- **Notebook**: [02-removing-stopwords.ipynb](02-removing-stopwords.ipynb)
- **Content**: Techniques for removing stopwords using libraries like NLTK, spaCy, and scikit-learn.

## Text Normalization

Explore text normalization techniques to standardize text data.

- **Notebook**: [03-text-normalization.ipynb](03-text-normalization.ipynb)
- **Content**: Lowercasing, removing punctuation, handling contractions, and whitespace removal.

## Stemming and Lemmatization

Learn about stemming and lemmatization to reduce words to their base forms.

- **Notebook**: [04-stemming-and-lemmatization.ipynb](04-stemming-and-lemmatization.ipynb)
- **Content**: Detailed explanations and examples of stemming and lemmatization using NLTK and spaCy.

## Installation

To use the Jupyter notebooks in this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
